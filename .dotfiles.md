## Bare Repository
A bare repository has no `.git` directory - it essentially is the `.git` repository! 
The directory containing the bare repository will contain all the git stuff like: HEAD, objects, refs, etc.
It has no working directory. It won't contain any actual source files, it will only ever contain the git config stuff.


## Setup
Create the bare repository in your home directory
```Shell
cd ~
git init --bare dotfiles
```

Create a useful bash alias:
```Shell
echo "alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```
Every time you type `config` in (bash) shell it will run git with the repository being `$HOME/dotfiles` and the working tree being `$HOME`

Use the new alias:
```Shell
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```
There will be a lot of files in your home directory that you don't want to track, so you don't what them to show up in `git status`.

Then start adding dotfiles to your repository:
```Shell
config add .bashrc
config add .gitconfig
...cd
```

Installation
```Shell
git clone --bare https://github.com/camjm/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
config checkout
```


### Homebrew
```Shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/cam/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Use the Homebrew package manager to install software such as VS Code, so you can automatically reinstall from the brewfile to bootstrap a new machine.

`brew bundle dump --describe`

This creates a file that shows the software that has been installed via Homebrew (it keeps track of what it has installed).
You can then copy this file to another machine and run it to install the sloftware.

`brew bundle --file ~/.dotfiles/Brewfile`
